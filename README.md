======

GUI 2 Go allows you to design, edit and build User Interfaces for your Android Apps from anywhere using your Android tablet.

I'm releasing this app as open source because I don't have the time to support it anymore. All improvements are welcome!
Note: The app is stable and working well on 10" tablets but it does not support smaller screens (for now). Also there might be some refactoring needed :)

## Installation

Simply clone the repo and import it to your IDE.

## Features

	* A complete WYSIWYG Android GUI Designer/Builder/Editor
    * Total independence from SDKs, IDEs, etc.
    * Management of your Projects, Activities and Resources
    * Share your design layouts with your friends and co-workers
